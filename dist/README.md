## Usage
The site is navigable via clicking the muscle buttons, each exercise, and the go back button to return to the index page. Each exercise has a heart, which when clicked, allows the user to save the exercise as a favorite to the favorite's section using local storage. The user can then press the clear button to clear the exercises and local storage.
